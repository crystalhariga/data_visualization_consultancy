# Data Visualization Consultancy
This is a team project for my Information Visualization class (Fall 2020) where my team performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau and R (ggplot2) to find opportunities for new small business owners to succeed in a post-pandemic world based on this [dataset](https://tracktherecovery.org).

## Files included:
1. final project.pdf -- Final presentation using insights obtained from Tableau and R
2. ggplot2_code.html -- Summary of R code that I contributed to the presentation
