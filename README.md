# Data Visualization Consultancy
This is a team project for my Information Visualization class (Fall 2020) where my team performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau and R (ggplot2) to find opportunities for new small business owners to succeed in a post-pandemic world based on this [dataset](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/tree/main/data).

## Files included:
1. final project.pdf -- Final presentation using insights obtained from Tableau and R
2. [ggplot2_code.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/crystalhariga/data_visualization_consultancy/blob/main/ggplot2_code.html) -- Summary of R code that I contributed to the presentation
