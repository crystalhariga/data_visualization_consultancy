# Post-COVID Small Business Launch
* Performed data preparation on 5 datasets (joining, aggregating, changing data types) using Tableau Prep and R
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to determine impact of COVID on small business owners and identify largest opportunities for upcoming small business owners
* Recommended upcoming small business owners:
    1. Ideal location: states with lower new COVID case rates (either west coast or central US); lower-income neighborhoods; near parks, transit stations, grocery stores, pharmacies
    2. Ideal industry: transportation supersector, including trade & utilities
    3. Ideal strategy: provide online experiences for customers and alternative options (pick-up, delivery, return, cancellation)

#### Background
This is a team project for my Information Visualization class (Fall 2020) where my team performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Tableau and R (ggplot2) to find opportunities for new small business owners to succeed in a post-pandemic world based on this [dataset](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/tree/main/data).
